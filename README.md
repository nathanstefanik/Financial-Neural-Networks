# Financial Neural Networks
Jupyter notebooks on using Tensorflow and Keras to build models on free data on securities.

## Current Notebooks
* XLY - closing price
* AAPL - open, high, low, close, adj close, volume

## To Do
* write up mathematical report on cross entropy
* Test models with other stocks (in the case of AAPL_NN) and other ETFs (in the case of XLY_NN)

## Conclusions so far
My work thus far has been focused on determining short term price movement of stocks and ETF's. If we estimate the models' real-world accuracy with their tested accuracy, then we would indeed have a winning trading strategy. However, I am unwilling to make this assumption yet and will have to test my models further.
